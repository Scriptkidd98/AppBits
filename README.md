# AppBits

AppBits is an open source web application that serves as a repository for application logics and components that developers can integrate into their projects. Developers can also discover, and get inspired by, pet projects from other developers. 

# Stack

Vite React(frontend). Firebase(auth, db, cloud services). Vercel(hosting).

# Get Started

To run AppBits locally, clone the main branch and run the following commands; 

`npm install`

`npm run dev`


# How You Can Contribute

## For new contributors

Create a new branch using format first_name-beta01 e.g isaac-beta01. That'll be your personal branch where you can push commits to, and create pull requests from.

## For returning contributors

Open a new issue, as detailed as possible. Fix and test issue locally. Create a pull request to dev branch, and await review and/or merge.

## Contribution Guidelines

Unless stack/technology specific, all other components must be developed in vanilla (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), to facilitate easy integration into multi stack applications.

HTML must be fully accessible, for keyboard and screen reader users.

Algorithms must follow best software practices.
